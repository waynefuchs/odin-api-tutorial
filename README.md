# API Tutorial for The Odin Project

The Odin Project assigned part 3 of a tutorial by Robin Wieruch titled [How to create a REST API with Express.js in Node.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/node-express-server-rest-api/).

[The Ultimate Guide to Passpor](https://dev.to/zachgoll/the-ultimate-guide-to-passport-js-k2l)

## Installation

If anyone is wanting to run this, for whatever reason, PostgreSQL is required. I used a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and pgAdmin to ensure that the ports were being forwarded properly, and initially to verify that sequalize was properly inserted data into the database.

Clone this repo.

Run `npm install` to install the packages.

A `.env` file should contain values such as:

```
# Web port
PORT=3000

# Postgres Details
DATABASE=api_tutorial
DATABASE_USER={Your Postgre Admin User}
DATABASE_PASSWORD={Your Database Password}
```

You will need to create a database with the name specified in this file, for me it is `api_tutorial`.

Edit the `src/index.js` file, and set `eraseDatabaseOnSync = true` on line 37, which will seed the database.

`npm run start` will run the project.

Make sure to set `eraseDatabaseOnSync = false`, unless you want to reset the data in the database every time you restart the application.
